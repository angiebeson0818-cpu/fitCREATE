# fitCREATE 👗✨

**fitCREATE** is a virtual try-on application designed to empower individuals by bridging the gap between digital shopping and personal confidence. 

Created by [Angie](https://angiecreates.pro), this tool is a core pillar of a mission to help people heal from negative body image and navigate life’s transitions—whether they are reinventing themselves after a divorce, starting a new business chapter, or simply learning to love the person in the mirror again.

## 🌟 The Vision
The "fitCREATE" experience is about more than just clothes; it’s about **visualization**. By allowing users to see how outfits look on their own digital twin, we remove the "fitting room anxiety" and replace it with a sense of excitement and self-assurance.

* **Confidence-First UI:** A workspace designed to be a protective, positive, and encouraging environment.
* **Seamless Integration:** Built to complement the healing resources found at `angiecreates.pro`.
